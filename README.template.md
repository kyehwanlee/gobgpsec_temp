# Project Title / Description

*This is mandatory*


One Paragraph of project description goes here.  What the software is
about What is the purpose of the software: Reference Implementation, ....

Link back to ANTD/NIST project page to put this project in context.

Example: 
The purpose of this project is to be a guideline for published code.
Published code is defined as code published on github that has an
associated MIDAS record.

And here is a lightly longer description.  It is no easy task to give
things away. Free is not enough. Code that is not re-used is about as
useful as papers that are not referenced. We hope to set standards for
ourselves before others set standards for us. We hope to make our code
well packaged and of high quality so others can use our work.  A PhD is
not required to read this writeup.... blah blah....


## Project Status

*Note: This is mandatory.*

[Active development| maintainance only| completed]


## Testing Summary

*This is mandatory*

Give a summary of the testing that has been done on this repository. Some
repositories may not be about code so it is OK to report this as NA or None
or even "reviewed" if applicable. Here are some suggested labels:


[none| partial|complete functional tests| interoperability tests| performance | scaling | robustness testing | conformance testing | public release testing]


## Getting Started

*Note: This is mandatory*

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See Installing for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Note: This is mandatory

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
What are dependencies (software/hardware/...)
Provide install scripts (e.g. pip dependencies.txt file) for pulling
dependencies whenever possible.

```
Give examples
```


### Building

*Note: This is project dependent. Some projects are just scripts (don't require building).
Projects that are code must include instructions on how to build it.*

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running and how to build the system.
This may not apply if your project is just some scripts.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

### Installing

*Note: This is project dependent.  Some projects are just scripts
(don't require installing).  Some projects could be specifications or
documentation - again don't require installing, Code projects mudt include
this section. Provide build targets or install scripts as appropriate.*

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to install a built system and do some sanity tests.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Quick Functional Test / Demo

*Note: Project dependent. Some projects don't lend themselves to quick tests but
if you can do a quick "hello world" test run, that is a great sales tactic.*

## Development Tests

*Note: This is project dependenent. Some projects (e.g. documentation
projects) do not require test scripts.*

Code projects must include tests and instructions on how to run them.
Tests should be automated whenever possible.  Feel free to add
sub-components as appropriate such as:

### Unit Test

*Note: This is project dependenent. Some projects (e.g. documentation
projects) do not require test scripts.*

Most code projects should have at least some testing which gives
the user some level of assurance that it works. Unit tests test code at a
component level. Publish instructions on how to run unit tests here. If
you have converage results, publish them here or point to where they
can be found. Boast about the quality of your test cases. It is good for
sales.

```
Give an example
```

### System Test

System tests test the whole system.  Add it if relevant to your project.
Publish results here or point to where results are published.  Boast about
the quality of your system tests. It is good for sales.

```
Give an example
```

### Performance Test

*Note: This is another possible sub-component if applicable.  Add it if relevant
to your project. Publish results here or point to where results are
published. Again publicize the test results for improved confidence in
your project.*

```
Give an example
```
